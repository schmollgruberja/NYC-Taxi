# NYC-Taxi
"In this competition, Kaggle is challenging you to build a model that predicts the total ride duration of taxi trips in New York City. Your primary dataset is one released by the NYC Taxi and Limousine Commission, which includes pickup time, geo-coordinates, number of passengers, and several other variables." - Kaggle 

In this final Project of Application Development (GIS) we want to develop and train a Machine Learning algorithm to be able to predict the approximate trip duration of a NYC Taxi. Needless to say, this prediction is not just helpful to determine driving time of taxis.
We decided to choose an educative, well documented approach - to be sure even laymens are able to understand the core steps in this project.
